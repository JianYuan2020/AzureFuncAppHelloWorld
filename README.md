# AzureFuncAppHelloWorld

Initially, I am learning how to develop Azure Functions here using VS2017, then VS2019.

Later, when I am practicing for tech interview coding with LeetCode or CodeSignal, this is my quick and easy place to get into the debugger. Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t capture the lengthy problem descriptions and input/output specifications here for you to understand why it is coded that way or why some edge cases are ignored (guaranteed from the input specs).

Each function works on premise by Azure storage emulator. I use the Postman to test/debug the functions (each function included at least 1 working URL).
